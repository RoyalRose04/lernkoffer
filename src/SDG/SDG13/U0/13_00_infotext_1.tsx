                                The climate crisis continues unabated as the global community shies away from the full
                                commitment required for its reversal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                2010-2019 was the warmest decade ever recorded, bringing with it massive wildfires,
                                hurricanes, droughts, floods and other climate disasters across continents.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If left unchecked, climate change will cause average global temperatures to increase
                                beyond 3Â°C and will adversely affect every ecosystem.

                                can lead to conflicts.

                                the biggest one of them all is our lack of commitments required to reverse the climate
                                crisis. We are seeing and feeling the extend of this crisis but still shy away to admit
                                and take responsibility.

                                To address climate change, we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;vastly increase our efforts. Much is

                                In 2015, the world took a significant first step by adopting the Paris Agreement, in
                                which all countries committed to take action to address climate change.&nbsp;&nbsp;
